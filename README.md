# Vibe Riding (prototype)

A fast first playable of the Vibe Riding concept.
The idea is to start vide coding in 3d environments/websites with your agent without solving a problems, but more hear the flow, let ideas, pictures thoughts arise. 
- Close your eyes, feel the flow and tell wispr flow. Just put it like this to your openclaw agent. The rest will just gonna build up. Find your path.

Content

- warp transition into a green Bauhaus world
- explorable 3D building + ambient beat
